=====

[dot.css](https://jfenn.me/styles/) is a simple CSS framework designed to be intuitive and effective.

## Usage

### NPM

You can install dot.css as an [NPM module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@doubledotlabs/dot.css):

```sh
npm install @doubledotlabs/dot.css
```

This provides the SCSS files at `node_modules/@doubledotlabs/dot.css/scss/styles.scss`. You can `@import` this file into
another SCSS file to set custom variables and integrate it with your site's build process.

### CDN

If you do not need to customize the CSS, you can include the compiled CSS in your HTML using [UNPKG](https://unpkg.com/browse/@doubledotlabs/dot.css/):

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@doubledotlabs/dot.css@{version}/dist/styles.css">
```

## Icons

These styles include the [`.material-icons`](https://google.github.io/material-design-icons/) web font by default, but are compatible with other alternatives (e.g. [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)) as well.
